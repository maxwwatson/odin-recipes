Project one, aka Project Recipes, for TOP

20 Dec 2023:

So, project completed. I'm on deployment so my time has been fairly limited, but I was able to knock this out today. 

Skills worked on:
1. Light flexbox
2. Centering content with margin auto and flexbox css
3. Making a nav bar
4. Some pseudo selectors 

There's things I have learned that I realized I could and should implement to make this more responsive, and better made (such as backup fonts, mobile site responsiveness, cleanin css in general) but I just want to move on and crush the next bit of the course. I'll come back later and fine tune this.

When I come back later I'll add more recipes, and try to use this as my hub of recipes I know and can make! I think I will separate this into meal prep, date night, and extravagent. 

Further reading:
I want to go more into reading about what specific elements to use. I could just put everything in divs, but I tried to use Header, Main, and footer. But even then, I could have used section, article, etc. Not sure the best places for everything, because I also dont want to use say a ton of element containers just for the hell of it. 

Further thoughts:
a href target=_blank, and ref="norefferer". Remember this
figcaption - not a fan of how it looks. Will omit for next ones
Try to do responsiveness all the time from now on, starting with build for mobile
Plan EVERYTHING out early. Stops for me were when I didn't think through what container would be the margin or flex centering, or how I wanted layout to work with css sorting it out, and etc. 
DESIGN - plan this out early too. Grab a colour palette, and think of the them for it and the feeling you are trying to convey. Take more time to plan. 
Using git more for moreso atomic commits, instead of gigantic chunks. 
Keep using terminal to create new files, and work on using it for copying and renaming too
IMGs - Actually think through the size of them, the filetype, and how you are going to work with this to optimize for different screens, and keep load time and etc low
